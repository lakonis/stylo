# Experimental UX for tagging

The considered use-case is to start from a generated JATS file
e.g. from a DOCX converter.
The JATS content has structural issues, e.g., wrong section levels, detached figure captions, etc., which need to be corrected.

The proposed UI let's the user select such content and apply certain tools that help to get from unstructured or wrong structured to well structured content.
